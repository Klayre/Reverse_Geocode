Automated Reverse-Geocoding (shanealynn)


Batch Reverse-Geocoding with Python and Google Geocoding API

This repository contains a python script to reverse-geocode multiple latitude/longitude using the Google Geocoding API.

Addresses can be reverse-geocoded for free at a rate of 2500 addresses per day, limited by Google. With a Google Developer API key, any number of addresses can be geocoded.

Data input and output is processed from CSV files.
